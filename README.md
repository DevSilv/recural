## License

This project has currently **no license**.

For details what does "no license" mean, see [this GitHub guide on "no license"](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/). A quote from that site:

> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

## Disclaimers

**The code that this project contains is an example code that is not intended to be run.** Its purpose is only to exemplify implementations of algorithms. While probably nothing dangerous would happen, you may run it only under your own responsibility.

**Pseudocode and any other form of algorithms that this project contains are examples, and they are not intended to be implemented.** Their purpose is only to exemplify my understanding of said algorithms. They are **not** to be treated as correct.

The code may contain bugs.

## Notes for correctness of algorithms and their implementations

If the pseudocode of an algorithm and any of the implementations of this algorithm differ in any way, neither of them has preference in terms of correctness.
