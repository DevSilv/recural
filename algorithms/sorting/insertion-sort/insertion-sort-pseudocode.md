# Insertion sort

## Input

- An array, elements of which are of a comparable type; the array, elements of which to sort

## Output

- An array, elements of which are the same elements as the given array, sorted in a specified order

## Description

In the insertion sort, elements in the array are iterated over, once. For each element, firstly the iteration stops. Then, this element is being moved to the beginning of the array (i.e., backwards), until either it is the first one, or the element preceding it is less or equal. Then, the iteration continues.
