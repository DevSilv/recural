# Selection sort

## Input

- An array, elements of which are of a comparable type; the array, elements of which to sort

## Output

- An array, elements of which are the same elements as the given array, sorted in a specified order

## Description

In the selection sort, elements in the array are iterated over, once. For each element, firstly the iteration stops. Then, the least element is searched, starting at the current element (inclusive), and ending at the last element of the array. If the current element is the least one, nothing happens; otherwise, the element found is swapped with the current one. Then, the iteration continues.
